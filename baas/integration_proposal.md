# Integration Proposal: Deploying "faces-community" on the BaaS Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a practical approach for integrating the **faces-community** smart contract ecosystem (comprising KDA, KSN, and KURT contracts) with the **Private Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)** platform.

The goal is to leverage the BaaS platform's automated infrastructure and management tools to deploy, operate, and scale the `faces-community` project efficiently and securely. This proposal aligns the project's specifics with the phases defined in the "Private blockchain as a Service â€“ Roadmap" and the technical specifications from the "Architecture Document".

## 2. Project and Platform Alignment

The `faces-community` project, with its modular three-contract architecture, is an ideal candidate for the BaaS platform. The platform provides the necessary private, controlled environment that a sophisticated DAO and token system requires.

Here is how the project maps to the BaaS roadmap phases:

*   **Phase 1: Architecture and Design**
    *   **Activity:** Review existing smart contracts.
    *   **Integration:** This phase will involve a detailed analysis of the KDA, KSN, and KURT contracts to finalize gas requirements, define access control policies for the private network, and prepare deployment scripts.

*   **Phase 2: Blockchain Network Implementation**
    *   **Activity:** Automate validator and RPC node deployments.
    *   **Integration:** The BaaS platform's provisioning service (using Terraform) will deploy a dedicated, private Hyperledger Besu network on GCP for the `faces-community` project. This includes setting up validator nodes with keys secured in GCP Cloud KMS.

*   **Phase 3: User Tooling**
    *   **Activity:** Deploy Block Explorer and Faucet.
    *   **Integration:** A BlockScout instance will be deployed, providing a web interface to explore transactions and interact with the KDA, KSN, and KURT contracts. A faucet will be set up to distribute initial funds for gas fees on the private network.

*   **Phase 4: Security & Monitoring**
    *   **Activity:** Deploy monitoring stack and implement backups.
    *   **Integration:** The platform's built-in Prometheus/Grafana stack will monitor the health of the Besu nodes running the `faces-community` contracts. Regular backups of the blockchain state will be stored securely in Google Cloud Storage.

## 3. Architectural Fit and Technical Strategy

The chosen architecture (GCP, Hyperledger Besu, Docker on GCE) is well-suited for the `faces-community` project for the following reasons:

*   **Controlled Environment:** A private PoA network using Hyperledger Besu's Clique engine provides a high-throughput, no-cost transaction environment perfect for the complex interactions between the KDA, KSN, and KURT contracts.
*   **Security:** Storing validator keys in **GCP Cloud KMS** ensures that the core security of the DAO and token network is handled by a dedicated, hardware-backed security module, rather than storing keys on disk.
*   **Isolation:** Deploying the entire `faces-community` network within its own **GCP Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** guarantees complete network and resource isolation, protecting it from external threats and other tenants on the BaaS platform.
*   **Scalability:** While starting with Docker on GCE simplifies the initial deployment, this architecture can be seamlessly migrated to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in the future as the project's performance and availability demands grow, without changing the core blockchain components.

## 4. Proposed Next Steps

1.  **Prepare Deployment Artifacts:**
    *   Compile the KDA, KSN, and KURT Solidity contracts.
    *   Create deployment scripts (e.g., using Hardhat or Truffle) tailored for a Besu network.
2.  **Configure IaC Templates:**
    *   Parameterize the BaaS platform's Terraform templates for a standard `faces-community` deployment (e.g., 3 validators, 1 RPC node).
3.  **Execute Pilot Deployment:**
    *   Run the provisioning pipeline to deploy a test version of the `faces-community` network on the BaaS platform.
4.  **Test and Validate:**
    *   Use the deployed Block Explorer and Faucet to interact with the contracts and verify that all functions of the DAO and token system operate as expected.
