# Epic: BaaS Platform Core Functionality

## Description
As a platform provider, I want to offer a "Private Blockchain as a Service" that allows clients to easily create, manage, and interact with their own private EVM-compatible blockchain networks, so that they can focus on developing their dApps without worrying about infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clients can request a new blockchain network via an API.
- The platform automatically provisions an isolated network on GCP using Terraform and Docker.
- Each provisioned network includes validator nodes, RPC nodes, a block explorer, and a faucet.
- Security is ensured through network isolation (VPC) and secure key management (GCP KMS).
- The platform provides monitoring and logging for the provisioned networks.
